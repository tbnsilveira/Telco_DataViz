# Telco_DataViz

In this project I seek to use Tableau to analyze the data from ANATEL -- Brazilian Telecommunications Agency, regarding the mobile accesses in Brazil from 2008 to 2018. [The final project is available on Tableau Public platform](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tbnsilveira#!/vizhome/Tableau_FinalProject_TBNSilveira_v2/Dashboard).  

A similar analysis is available on [ANATEL Web Portal](http://www.anatel.gov.br/dados/destaque-1/283-brasil-tem-236-2-milhoes-de-linhas-moveis-em-janeiro-de-2018), which can be compared with this one.  

This repository have the data (CSV); the Jupyter notebook in R used to turn data in a tidy format; and the Tableau workbook file, in two different versions (please consider only the 'v2' file).
